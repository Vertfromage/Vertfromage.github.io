# Welcome to my games page. 

I'm not feeling like trying to make this pretty. I think I enjoy programming more than decorating. Oh, dear I'm becoming more self-aware time to move on...

## List of games:

- **Wall Ball**
   [Play the Game!](https://vertfromage.github.io./games/backSideBall/index.html)

   This is my game submission for [JS13KGAMES](https://js13kgames.com/ "js13kgames.com").  It's also the first HTML5 canvas game I ever made. And the 2nd html/javascript game I ever made. The first game was a straight html/javascript pong game that was only minimally modified from the tutorial.

- **End of List**
   Sorry that's it so far.
