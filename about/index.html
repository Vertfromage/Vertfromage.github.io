           <h1>About Crystal...</h1>

<p>Hi, I'm Crystal Parker, a Full Stack Engineer with experience building scalable, high-quality software. In January 2025, I began my role as an Associate Software Engineer at Level Access, where I contribute to developing accessible, cutting-edge technology using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js). My work focuses on ensuring digital platforms are inclusive for everyone.</p>

<p>Previously, I worked for the web3 company Koii Network, where I expanded my skills and contributed to innovative projects. My technical toolkit includes JavaScript, HTML5, React, NodeJS, MongoDB, SQL, Python, C#, Docker, AWS, Oracle, and more.</p>

<p>I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science with Honours and a minor in Biology from Dalhousie University (May 2024). My honors project, guided by Professor Nur Zincir-Heywood, explored the fascinating intersection of Mobile Gaming and Security. During this time, I also completed the ICTC Cybersecurity Training and Work Integrated Learning program, further enhancing my expertise.</p>

<p>I've honed my HTML5 skills by participating in JS13kgames, developing multiple HTML5 games, and completing websites using Flask and Django frameworks. In the past I collaborated on a 3D game using C#, Blender, and Unity, and worked with a senior web developer on an HTML5 JavaScript game integrated with the NEAR protocol.</p>

<p>Beyond coding, I have a variety of interests. I built my own skin-on-frame canoe with my father, enjoy hiking and camping with my vintage trailer, and love skateboarding. I also have an antique car, a 1953 Hudson Jet, as a hobby. Additionally, I'm an artist, having done portrait commissions and had paintings exhibited in a gallery.</p>

<p>Let's connect and create something amazing together!</p>
