### Welcome to my games page. 

I'm not feeling like trying to make this pretty. I think I enjoy programming more than decorating. Oh dear, I'm becoming more self-aware, time to move on...

## Polished Games:
- **Mr. Brown Ice Breaker 2022**
[Play here!](https://neararcade.com/mrbrown/) Game collaboration with [Curtis Robinson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/curtis-robinson-31b11115/) and art by [Lomaking](https://mrbrownproject.com/) 

- **Math Dungeons 2020**
[Current](https://vertfromage.github.io/games/mathDungeonsPhaser/index.html) ,and [Super early Prototype](https://vertfromage.github.io./games/mathdungeons/mathdungeons.html) I made it using phaser in 2020. I tried doing a kickstarter to see if anyone was interested in it. I didn't get enough traction so I moved on. 

## Course Games
- ** Assignment 1 : Individual 3D platformer
[Video Demo](https://youtu.be/H0IWnuxk0kI) I made this for my Game Development course at Dalhousie University. It's made with Unity using pre-builds provided by the professor. I enjoyed the assignment and found that C# as used in Unity for scripting was no problem. I got 100% on the assignment.   

## Hackathon Games

- **Journey to the East; Silk Road Adventure**
[Play here!](https://vertfromage.github.io/js13k-2023/) I made this for [JS13Kgames 2023](https://js13kgames.com/entries/journey-to-the-east-silk-road-adventure) I came in 44th out of 163, which is shockingly good for me. I probably would have done even better except there were still problems with my resizing function on some devices... I probably could have fixed it but I was getting worn out on it. I still haven't fixed it, so if it doesn't resize properly on your screen I'm sorry. 
   
- **Mirrored Planes**
[Play here!](https://vertfromage.github.io/games/planes/) I made this for [JS1024 2022](https://js1024.fun/demos/2022/8) for my entry I had to cut out the actual game play to make it small enough so it was only an visual experiment that I ended up submitting. I got 24th place. 

- **Incomplete game: Burning Plants**
[Try here](https://js13kgames.com/entries/burning-the-plants) I guess I didn't really know what to do for JS13k 2022 when the theme was death... I started to go with this idea about killing plants, I was going to have a fire sprite vs a water sprite and you play as the fire sprite. I wasn't really super enthusiastic about the idea so I ran out of time and didn't finish. I helped curtis with the decentralized part of his entry though so I feel like I participated this year. [Curtis' entry](https://js13kgames.com/entries/world-of-emojis) the [contract](https://github.com/Vertfromage/near-pets) I did for him using the js SDK for near protocol 

- **Human Guild Game Jam**
I made a fun platformer game [Pretty Lost In Space](https://itch.io/jam/human-game-jam/rate/1443388) using LittleJS game engine based on the pretty punks NFT collection on NEAR, it used the NFT marketplace API to pull in the NFT as a pilot based on user account. I got 3rd place, there were only 5 submissions. This is also where I met Curtis.
   
- **Jeff's Nightmare**
[Play here!](https://js13kgames.com/entries/jeffs-nightmare)
This was my entry for JS13kgames 2021, I learned just enough of NEAR protocol's documentation to implement a login. I won 10th place in decentralized, mostly because not many people tried to enter the category. 

- **Space invasion simulator**
[Play here](https://js13kgames.com/entries/space-invasion-simulator) This was another entry for JS13kgames 2021, I actually spent more time on this than on Jeff's nightmare, I only did that one to prove to myself I could implement the decentralized category. I was told the music was annoying, and it was laggy. 

- **Robot Mission 404**
[Play here](https://vertfromage.github.io/games/RobotMission404/game.html)
This was my entry for js13k games 2020, the theme was 404. A choose your own adventure game featuring an amnesiac robot. Controls include arrow keys, y/n, and space, theres also a level editor available to coil members, so they can customize their experience. I made the music with [ZzFXM](https://keithclark.github.io/ZzFXM/) by just basically fiddling around until I found something that sounded okayish... I'm not musical, so don't blame me if it's very basic. This was my [postmortem](https://vertfromage.github.io/update/2020/09/25/Robot-Mission-404-JS13KGames-2020.html)

- **Backside Ball**
   [Play the Game!](https://vertfromage.github.io/games/backSideBall/index.html)
This was my game submission for [JS13k Games 2019](https://js13kgames.com/entries/backside-ball) .  It's also the first HTML5 canvas game I ever made. And the 2nd html/javascript game I ever made. This is my [postmortem](https://vertfromage.github.io./update/2019/09/19/entering-JS13KGames-2019-beginner.html).

- **Basic Pong**
For my first Pong game, I followed this [tutorial]( https://medium.com/@hershybateea/how-to-make-pong-with-javascript-1a6bd6226ea1) this was my first try at making a javascript game, it gave me the confidence to try something harder.
