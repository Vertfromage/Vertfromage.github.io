    <h1>White Paper</h1>
    <h2>Where I explain my project.</h2>
    <p>
        I made this project to illustrate an idea about how NFT events can bring the metaverse into the 'IRL' real world. 
    </p>
    <p>When an event is organized, the organizers will frequently make connections with local bussiness establishments in the surrounding area to negotiate discounts for those attending. </p>
    <p>For example, if I hosted a Rugged Nova Scotia NFT Retreat where all you jet setters flew to Nova Scotia so we could hang out and talk about NFT's. In that case, I could negotiate a group rate at the local campground, the kayak adventure company, the lobster store and the local pub.</p>
    <p>Many events will print out coupons that the attendees can show to the establishments to take advantage of these pre-negotiated deals, but in the case of a nft event, the nft based ticket could also double as proof for redemption. If the establishment wanted to limit the coupon to one per person they could keep a record of the ticket-id's that had already been redeemed.</p>
    <p>Organizing NFT events in this manner, by negotiating special prices at venues around your event could lead to the exposure of more average business people to Near leading to mass adoption.</p>

    <h2>Potential for future development</h2>
    <p>I'm not an advanced developer, I undertook this project as an expression of my idea. To further develop this into a real project I would need a more advanced partner, a developer with business experience interested in building out an NFT Event Swag Tag marketplace.</p>
    <p>If anyone is intrested in teaming up in the future, this is where I invision this project going:</p>
    <p>A marketplace for events that use NFT's as tickets that have IRL benefits like discounts at local businesses, prize draws, swag giveaways.</p>
    <p>A DAO that organizes small to medium sized events.</p>
    <p>Negotiating longterm swag tag contracts with tourist based organizations, so that for big events a discount can have longterm value.</p>
    <p>A web app that will allow businesses to track number of redeptions against the swag tags so that they can see the value of the arrangement leading to more interest in the future.</p>
    <p>In the meantime I'm going to keep learning. I'm a bit of a wild card right now, but who knows what I man accomplish in the future.</p>

    <h2>Fun promise</h2>
    <p>Not holding my breath, but if I win a prize and at least 10 people want me to, I'll mint my swag tag on a recognized NFT market on near and host a Rugged Nova Scotia NFT Retreat.</p>
