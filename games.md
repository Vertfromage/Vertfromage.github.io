### Welcome to my games page. 

I'm not feeling like trying to make this pretty. I think I enjoy programming more than decorating. Oh, dear I'm becoming more self-aware time to move on...

## List of games:

- **Wall Ball**
   [Play the Game!](https://vertfromage.github.io./games/backSideBall/index.html)

   This is my game submission for [JS13KGAMES](https://js13kgames.com/ "js13kgames.com").  It's also the first HTML5 canvas game I ever made. And the 2nd html/javascript game I ever made. This is my [postmortem](https://vertfromage.github.io./update/2019/09/19/entering-JS13KGames-2019-beginner.html).

- **Basic Pong**
    Secret Javascript Pong game hidden on Dad's church website [Play Here](https://www.riversidealbertchurch.com/pong), followed [tutorial]( https://medium.com/@hershybateea/how-to-make-pong-with-javascript-1a6bd6226ea1) this was my first try at making a javascript game, it gave me the confidence to try something harder.

- **End of List**
   Sorry that's it so far.
