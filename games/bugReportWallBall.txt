List of bugs

- Mooning animation is out of sync 
- Sprite keeps apearing outside floor area on right side, something wrong with my if question
- ball gets stuck temporarily and grinds sound when at the very edge of paddle.
- smart phone only detects tap not swipe
- screen keeps getting wiggled around when using cell phone. 
- slight delay with cell phone need to detect swipe.

Features I'd like:
- Coins that are dropped after blue gremlin is hit
- Gremlin dancing on the front page / restart page
- Maybe it would be better to simplify keyboard keys to only left/right
