List of bugs (sorted by importance)
- smart phone only detects tap not swipe
- screen keeps getting wiggled around when using cell phone. 
- start and restart screens don't resized
- start and restart screens are plain and boring.
- ball gets stuck temporarily and grinds sound when at the very edge of paddle.
- Is blue gremlin the right size?
- ball sometimes hits coin right after restarting - tried a setTimeOut function call, it sort of fixed the ball but broke my emptyCoins call in endGame, so I put it back for now. Alternatively I could quit holding the ball during the mooning sequence.    


Features I'd like:
2. Gremlin dancing on the front page / restart page
3. Maybe it would be better to simplify keyboard keys to only left/right

Things I fixed, yay me!

- Mooning animation is out of sync - fixed by changing from counter to boolean right in update method
- Sprite keeps apearing outside floor area on right side, - fixed by using canvas measurements directly for if question
- moving paddle should change direction of ball - fixed by changing mouseBall function and adding mouse movement to it
- Needs a better name something to do with 'back.' - changed to Backend ball tee hee!
- Added feature: Coins that are dropped after blue gremlin is hit
