**Random Idea**

I can't find my journal so I'm recording my random idea here for later. 

Here's the thought, I could make an animated kids movie. All I'd need is a script and some sprite sheets for cute little characters. It's like a video game except without the character inputs, just screen capture then record voices over the top, or do a silent film. I could do something super basic with js canvas and spritesheets. It would make a fun christmas present, just as good as a crosstitch.
