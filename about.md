I live in NS Canada with my husband and 4 daughters; 3 of whom I homeschool.  I enjoy staying home with my children; where I can freely explore and develop my abilities and interests, wherever my passions lead me. Currently, that includes computer programming, fine art, and graphic art. Brilliant women seldom limit themselves to one interest.
