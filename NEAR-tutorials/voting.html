    <h1>A "GOOD TUTORIAL" for writing a voting smart contract on NEAR in TypeScript</h1>
    <h2>Hackathon Style</h2>

    <section>
        <h3>Find a starting point.</h3>
        <p>It's a hackathon, so don't start from scratch. I decided to start with the <a
                href="https://examples.near.org/guest-book">NEAR guestbook example.</a> So, since this is a tutorial
            that's what you should do. In your ubuntu console git clone the repository:
        </p>
        <code>git clone https://github.com/near-examples/guest-book.git</code>
        <p>You might want to look at the code first before you start changing it, but we;re going to focus on two files
            since this is a TypeScript tutorial. Those files are in the assembly folder: model.ts and main.ts</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Think about what you need.</h3>
        <p>For this hackathon the assignment was:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Assume this is a smart contract for voting on a US president.</p>
            <p>The contract should have the following methods:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Add candidate: adds a potential candidate that users can vote on</li>
                <li>View candidates: view all the candidates and the number of votes they have</li>
                <li>Vote: anyone with a NEAR wallet can vote on one candidate once</li>
            </ol>
        </blockquote>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Helpful tips:</h3>
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li>If you've not already successfully deployed an example like guestbook, open up guestbook in gitpod and
                follow along there, the enviroment is all set up correct.</li>
            <li>You can get out of the automatic reload on gitpod with ctrl-c</li>
            <li>If you need to reset the contract, use command
                <code> near delete dev-1637781961540-88813141112651 YOURACCOUNT.testnet </code> and delete the lines
                with the dev-1637781961540-88813141112651 lines in the two files in /neardev folder. Then you should
                rebuild the contract with command <code>yarn build:contract</code> and the command
                <code> near dev-deploy </code></li>
            <li>If you're in your own enviroment you need to run yarn to start so that all the depencies get pulled in... or something like that, I'm still learning.</li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Start making changes, model.ts</h3>
        <p>So now we can start making changes, or if you prefer you can delete everything in model.ts and main.ts and
            just add code as I explain it.</p>
        <p>So you need to add a candidate, that's sort of like adding a comment right? So let's look at the model.ts
            file we have a model for PostedMessage, let's change that to Candidate:</p>
        <pre><code>
        @nearBindgen
        export class Candidate {
          votes: number;
          constructor(public name: string) {
            this.votes=0;
          }
        }</code></pre>
        <p>Lovely, now we have a Candidate! We also need a way to add votes:</p>
        <pre><code>
            /**
            * addvote method
            */
           public addvote():void {
             this.votes ++;
           }</code></pre>
        <p>That goes inside the candidate class and together it looks like this:</p>
        <pre><code>
               @nearBindgen
            export class Candidate {
              votes: number;
              constructor(public name: string) {
                this.votes=0;
              }
            }
              /**
               * addvote method
               */
              public addvote():void {
                this.votes ++;
              }
            }</code></pre>
        <p>Then you'll want to change the PersistentVector from being for messages to being for Candidates: </p>
        <pre><code>export const candidates = new PersistentVector<Candidate>("m");</code></pre>
        <p>Since we're already in this file, let's think about one more change we can make, we only want each person to
            vote once, so let's keep track of who has already voted: </p>
        <pre><code>// A list of users to see who has voted already.
export const users = new PersistentSet<String>("u");</code></pre>
        <p>Don't forget to make sure you have all the imports:</p>
        <pre><code>import { context, u128, PersistentVector, PersistentSet } from "near-sdk-as";</code></pre>
        <p>By the way if you're in gitpod, you can ctrl-click on the node modules to explore the code, it'll clear up
            some details about how/why certain things do or do not work.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Make more changes, main.ts</h3>
        <p>Now in main.ts, we have addMessages and getMessages, we need to addCandidates and viewCandidates, almost the
            same right?</p>
        <p>Add candidate: </p>
        <pre><code>
        export function addCandidate(name: string): void {
            // Creating a new candidate and populating fields with our data
            const candidate = new Candidate(name);
            // Adding the candidate to end of the the persistent collection
            candidates.push(candidate);
          }
    </code></pre>
        <p>Get candidate: </p>
        <pre>
    <code>/**
        * Returns an array of last N messages.\
        * NOTE: This is a view method. Which means it should NOT modify the state.
        */
        export function getCandidates(): Candidate[] {
         const numCandidates = candidates.length;
         const result = new Array<Candidate>(numCandidates);
         for(let i = 0; i < numCandidates; i++) {
           result[i] = candidates[i];
         }
         return result;
       }</code>
    </pre>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Write some code from scratch</h3>
        <p>So we've run out of methods and we still need a vote method... so start with an empty method that takes in
            the candidate's name and sends out a success message</p>
        <pre><code>
        /**
 * Vote method 
 */
export function vote(candidate: string): string {
  return "";
}
    </code></pre>
        <p>Then we can add a check to see if the current voter has already voted.</p>
        <pre><code>
        /**
        * Vote method 
        */
       export function vote(candidate: string): string {
         // Checking if user has already voted
         if(!users.has(context.sender)){
             //They didn't vote yet...
         }
         return "You already voted!";
       }
        </code></pre>
    <p>Then we can add a vote if they're inside the didn't vote if block, let's just ignore the rest of the code and
        focus on inside that if block: </p>
<pre><code>
        // Adding the vote
        const numCandidates = candidates.length;

        // looping through the candidates
        for(let i = 0; i < numCandidates; i++) {
        // find the one that matches 
        if(candidates[i].name==candidate){

            // To get at the Candidate object we need to temporarily put it in a variable.
            const c = candidates[i];

            // use the method we wrote
            c.addvote();

            // re-assign the object overwriting what was there.
            candidates[i] = c;

            // record that this user voted
            users.add(context.sender);

            // send success message!
            return "Successful vote for "+c.name+"!";
        }}
        </code></pre>
    <p>So, we're pretty much done, but to be really user friendly we should tell them if they voted for a candidate
        that doesn't exist so they can vote again, or remind them that they only had one vote incase they tried to
        vote twice. You can add that in on your own or look at the complete method below: </p>
    <pre><code>
 /**
 * Vote method 
 */
export function vote(candidate: string): string {
  // Checking if user has already voted
  if(!users.has(context.sender)){
  // Adding the vote
  const numCandidates = candidates.length;
  // looping through the candidates
  for(let i = 0; i < numCandidates; i++) {
    if(candidates[i].name==candidate){
        const c = candidates[i];
        c.addvote();
        candidates[i] = c;
        users.add(context.sender);
        return "Successful vote for "+c.name+"!";
    }}
  }
  return "Your candidate doesn't exist!!";
  }
  return "You already voted!";
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>And once again don't forget imports!</p>
    <pre><code>
        import { context, u128 } from 'near-sdk-core';
        import {  users, authorized, Candidate, candidates } from './model';</code></pre>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Get it on testnet!!</h3>
        <p>This isn't hard. Just a few steps.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Delete dev stuff</li>
            <p>dev-1637781961540-88813141112651 is just an example you need to find your exact one.</p>
            <pre><code> near delete dev-1637781961540-88813141112651 YOURACCOUNT.testnet </code></pre><p> Also delete the lines with the dev-1637781961540-88813141112651 lines in the two files in /neardev folder.</p>
            <li>Build Contract</li>
            <p>I think this turns the typescript into web assembly... </p>
            <pre><code>yarn build:contract</code></pre>
            <li>Make a sub account</li>
            <pre><code>near create-account vote.you.testnet --masterAccount you.testnet</code></pre>
            <li>Deploy</li>
            <p>This one line deploys it to testnet!!</p>
            <pre><code>near deploy --accountId vote.you.testnet --wasmFile out/main.wasm</code></pre>
        </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Call your contract from the command line</h3>
        <p>view calls don't change anything...</p>
        <pre><code>near view vote.you.testnet getCandidates '{}'</code></pre>
        <p>Of course if you call that before you add anyone you might get an error... lol</p>
        <p>call calls change things...</p>
        <pre><code>
            near call vote.you.testnet addCandidate '{"name":"Vertfromage"}' --accountId you.testnet</code></pre>
        <p>You might want to add more than one candidate...</p>
        <p>Finally you can vote...</p>
        <p>....</p>
        <p>....</p>
        <p>....</p>
        <p>.... What! You're not going to try to figure it out on your own?</p>
        <p>....</p>
        <p>....</p>
        <p>.... I guess I'll tell you...</p>
        <pre><code>near call vote.you.testnet vote '{"candidate":"Vertfromage"}' --accountId you.testnet</code></pre>
        <p>Also if you get tired of typing out 'vote.you.testnet' you can use this command:</p>
        <pre><code>export ID=vote.you.testnet</code></pre>
        <pre><code>near view $ID getCandidates '{}'</code></pre>
