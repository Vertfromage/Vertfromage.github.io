**History of my progress as a programmer:

* Aug 3, 2017 - Completed my first programming course [MITx 6.00.1x](https://courses.edx.org/certificates/b5b76097fe4744a6a5b291b0415df7da "Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python Certificate")
* May 2, 2018 - Completed a second programming course [Hardvardx CS50](https://courses.edx.org/certificates/85a4648c716b4ed1b3f2f43b765a8620 "CS50's Introduction to Computer Science Certificate")
* Summer 2018 - Built a [website](https://www.riversidealbertchurch.com "My final project for CS50") for a small rural church in New Brunswick using Flask Framework.
* Spring 2019 Completed [MITx 6.00.2x]( https://courses.edx.org/certificates/675b83f497ad40f7a4896e4055c51d35), got 87% should have studied, might have done better, good news: I realized that datascience isn't "my thing."
* May 2019 Completed Lighthouse Labs 21-Day Javascript coding challenge. Super easy, really fun, my only complaint being that I didn't win a prize. 
* May 2019 Discovered and played with hacker rank. Gold Badge in Java [Profile](https://www.hackerrank.com/vertfromage?)
* August 2019 Secret Javascript Pong game hidden on Dad's church website [Play Here](https://www.riversidealbertchurch.com/pong), followed [tutorial]( https://medium.com/@hershybateea/how-to-make-pong-with-javascript-1a6bd6226ea1) lots of fun.
* September 2019 Made a pong spin-off game for js13KGAMES - [Contest Page](https://js13kgames.com/entries/backside-ball) or [Play Here](https://vertfromage.github.io./games/backSideBall/index.html).  Not expecting to win, it would be nice to get a t-shirt, but with 242 enteries and only 100 t-shirts, a total newb like me hasn't got a chance. I'm going to vote for my favorites. Wrote a [postmortem](https://vertfromage.github.io./update/2019/09/19/entering-JS13KGames-2019-beginner.html).
* HacktoberFest 2019 - Opened up my text based java game for hacktoberfest contributions, lots of fun, 19 total contributors. 
* Currently working on learning Java from Tim Buchalka on Udemy, cocurrently working on his android app course, and hoping to do Android LibGDX Game Development next.
