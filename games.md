### Welcome to my games page. 

I'm not feeling like trying to make this pretty. I think I enjoy programming more than decorating. Oh, dear I'm becoming more self-aware, time to move on...

## Polished Games:
- **Mr. Brown Ice Breaker 2022**
[Play here!](https://neararcade.com/mrbrown/) Game collaboration with [Curtis Robinson](linkedin.com/in/curtis-robinson-31b11115) and art by [Lomaking](https://mrbrownproject.com/) 

- **Math Dungeons 2020**
[Current](https://vertfromage.github.io/games/mathDungeonsPhaser/index.html) ,and [Super early Prototype](https://vertfromage.github.io./games/mathdungeons/mathdungeons.html) I made it using phaser in 2020. I tried doing a kickstarter to see if anyone was interested in it. I didn't get enough traction so I moved on. 


## Hackathon Games
   
-**Mirrored Planes**
[Play here!](https://vertfromage.github.io/games/planes/) I made this for [JS1024 2022](https://js1024.fun/demos/2022/8) for my entry I had to cut out the actual game play to make it small enough so it was only an visual experiment that I ended up submitting. I got 24th place. 

**Incomplete game: Burning Plants**
[Try here](https://js13kgames.com/entries/burning-the-plants) I guess I didn't really know what to do for JS13k 2022 when the theme was death... I started to go with this idea about killing plants, I was going to have a fire sprite vs a water sprite and you play as the fire sprite. I wasn't really super enthusiastic about the idea so I ran out of time and didn't finish. I helped curtis with the decentralized part of his entry though so I feel like I participated this year. [Curtis' entry](https://js13kgames.com/entries/world-of-emojis) the [contract](https://github.com/Vertfromage/near-pets) I did for him using the js SDK for near protocol 
   
- **Jeff's Nightmare**
[Play here!](https://js13kgames.com/entries/jeffs-nightmare)
This was my entry for JS13kgames 2021, I learned just enough of NEAR protocol's documentation to implement a login. I won 10th place in decentralized, mostly because not many people tried to enter the category. 

- **Space invasion simulator**
[Play here](https://js13kgames.com/entries/space-invasion-simulator) This was another entry for JS13kgames 2021, I actually spent more time on this than on Jeff's nightmare, I only did that one to prove to myself I could implement the decentralized category. I was told the music was annoying, and it was laggy. 

- **Robot Mission 404**
[Play here](https://vertfromage.github.io/games/RobotMission404/game.html)
This was my entry for js13k games 2020, the theme was 404. A choose your own adventure game featuring an amnesiac robot. Controls include arrow keys, y/n, and space, theres also a level editor available to coil members, so they can customize their experience. I made the music with [ZzFXM](https://keithclark.github.io/ZzFXM/) by just basically fiddling around until I found something that sounded okayish... I'm not musical, so don't blame me if it's very basic. This was my [postmortem](https://vertfromage.github.io/update/2020/09/25/Robot-Mission-404-JS13KGames-2020.html)

- **Backside Ball**
   [Play the Game!](https://vertfromage.github.io/games/backSideBall/index.html)
This was my game submission for [JS13k Games 2019](https://js13kgames.com/entries/backside-ball) .  It's also the first HTML5 canvas game I ever made. And the 2nd html/javascript game I ever made. This is my [postmortem](https://vertfromage.github.io./update/2019/09/19/entering-JS13KGames-2019-beginner.html).

- **Basic Pong**
    Secret Javascript Pong game hidden on Dad's church website [Play Here](https://www.riversidealbertchurch.com/pong), followed [tutorial]( https://medium.com/@hershybateea/how-to-make-pong-with-javascript-1a6bd6226ea1) this was my first try at making a javascript game, it gave me the confidence to try something harder.
