**History of my progress as a programmer:**

* Aug 3, 2017 - Completed my first programming course [MITx 6.00.1x](https://courses.edx.org/certificates/b5b76097fe4744a6a5b291b0415df7da "Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python Certificate")
* May 2, 2018 - Completed a second programming course [Hardvardx CS50](https://courses.edx.org/certificates/85a4648c716b4ed1b3f2f43b765a8620 "CS50's Introduction to Computer Science Certificate")
* Summer 2018 - Built a [website](https://www.riversidealbertchurch.com "My final project for CS50") for a small rural church in New Brunswick using Flask Framework.
* Spring 2019 Completed [MITx 6.00.2x]( https://courses.edx.org/certificates/675b83f497ad40f7a4896e4055c51d35), got 87% should have studied, might have done better, good news: I realized that datascience isn't "my thing."
* Did a test run of Django - Set up a cutie site for my daughter to play with... not always running since it's a free acount on Python Anywhere [Check it out!](http://lilyqueenb.pythonanywhere.com/) If I make another real website I'll probably use Django instead of Flask. 
* May 2019 Completed Lighthouse Labs 21-Day Javascript coding challenge. Super easy, really fun, my only complaint being that I didn't win a prize. 
* May 2019 Discovered and played with hacker rank. Gold Badge in Java [Profile](https://www.hackerrank.com/vertfromage?)
* August 2019 Secret Javascript Pong game hidden on Dad's church website [Play Here](https://www.riversidealbertchurch.com/pong), followed [tutorial]( https://medium.com/@hershybateea/how-to-make-pong-with-javascript-1a6bd6226ea1) lots of fun.
* September 2019 Made a pong spin-off game for js13KGAMES - [Contest Page](https://js13kgames.com/entries/backside-ball) or [Play Here](https://vertfromage.github.io./games/backSideBall/index.html).  Not expecting to win, it would be nice to get a t-shirt, but with 242 enteries and only 100 t-shirts, a total newb like me hasn't got a chance. (Update: Didn't even make it into top 200! Haha, so I bought one!) I'm going to vote for my favorites. Wrote a [postmortem](https://vertfromage.github.io./update/2019/09/19/entering-JS13KGames-2019-beginner.html).
* HacktoberFest 2019 - Opened up my text based java game for hacktoberfest contributions, lots of fun, 19 total contributors. 
* Jan 31st 2020 Made a website about the [coronavirus](www.thecoronavirus.ca) using Mezzanine CMS
* Febuary 2020 Made a website for [Captains Inn](www.captainsinnalma.ca/) in Alma NB for a 2 night stay on my anniversary... unfortunately put on hold due to covid19. Boo hoo.
* May 2020 participated in [Shiftkey Labs](https://shiftkeylabs.ca/) Virtual Covid19 Hackathon. Put together a prototype for a hospital locating [mobile web app](https://pranav16.pythonanywhere.com/). Alot of fun, I was one of 80 participants chosen out of 255 applicants, our team didn't win a prize, but one of the judges mentioned our project in his closing statements, one of our team members was from bangladesh and our project was meant to solve the problem of patients going to the wrong hospitals.

**Currently Working on**
* Learning Java from Tim Buchalka on Udemy(34% completed), cocurrently working on his android app course(35% completed), and his Android LibGDX Game Development(45% completed). 
* Taking a break from Java to do a short course on HTML5 game engine phaser, might be a shortcut to implementing some of my cool kids educational game ideas. 

**Goals**
- Publish an educational game app to the Android app store.
- Do a part-time summer internship with a company in Halifax, NS that makes Android/Apple apps or mobile games.
- Make a fancy Developer's Portfolio site with fun animations.
- Get a CS degree remotely using previous incomplete BSc credits to fill in the electives.
- Take a business course on marketing. 
- Use programming skills and creative ideas to earn a full salary as a entrepreneur.
