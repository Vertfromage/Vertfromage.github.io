        <p>
          Welcome to my collection of hobby games! These projects are a mix of
          experiments, course assignments, and game jam entries that I've
          created over the years. They're not perfect, but they've been a great
          way for me to learn and have fun with coding. Feel free to explore and
          check out the code behind them. Enjoy!
        </p>

          ><br />
          I made this with a team for my Game Development course at Dalhousie
          University. MalSalvo’s Last Stand is a tower defense game developed in
          Unity 3D. It’s a spin on the traditional defense games. In this game,
          players take up the role of a mad scientist defending their tower from
          aliens on planets in outer space.

          <strong>Assignment 1: Individual 3D platformer</strong><br />
          <a href="https://youtu.be/H0IWnuxk0kI">Video Demo</a> I made this for
          my Game Development course at Dalhousie University. It's made with
          Unity using pre-builds provided by the professor. I enjoyed the
          assignment and found that C# as used in Unity for scripting was no
          problem. I got 100% on the assignment.

        <p>
          <strong>Dad Simulator</strong><br />
          Built on Unity with a team of 6, I did the carry script for moving
          laundry/garbage around the house minigames and set up the navMesh and
          the scripts for the annoying child minigame. Other members did all the
          amazing 3D models, cooking minigames, UI, etc. Someone was doing a
          lawnmower minigame but ran out of time.

          <strong>Teaboy and Watergirl</strong><br />
          Built on Unity for a short game jam. Used an overly complicated
          platformer controller and it got messed up. Lots of bugs.

          <a href="https://vertfromage.github.io/js13k-2023/">Play here!</a> I
          made this for
          <a

            >JS13Kgames 2023</a
          >. I came in 44th out of 163, which is shockingly good for me. I
          probably would have done even better except there were still problems
          with my resizing function on some devices... I probably could have
          fixed it but I was getting worn out on it. I still haven't fixed it,
          so if it doesn't resize properly on your screen I'm sorry.

          made this for
          <a href="https://js1024.fun/demos/2022/8">JS1024 2022</a> for my entry
          I had to cut out the actual game play to make it small enough so it
          was only a visual experiment that I ended up submitting. I got 24th
          place.

            >Try here</a
          >. I guess I didn't really know what to do for JS13k 2022 when the
          theme was death... I started to go with this idea about killing
          plants, I was going to have a fire sprite vs a water sprite and you
          play as the fire sprite. I wasn't really super enthusiastic about the
          idea so I ran out of time and didn't finish. I helped Curtis with the
          decentralized part of his entry though so I feel like I participated
          this year.

          I made a fun platformer game

            >Pretty Lost In Space</a
          >
          using LittleJS game engine based on the pretty punks NFT collection on
          NEAR, it used the NFT marketplace API to pull in the NFT as a pilot
          based on user account. I got 3rd place, there were only 5 submissions.
          This is also where I met Curtis.

          This was my entry for JS13kgames 2021, I learned just enough of NEAR
          protocol's documentation to implement a login. I won 10th place in
          decentralized, mostly because not many people tried to enter the
          category.

          <strong>Space invasion simulator</strong><br />
          <a href="https://js13kgames.com/entries/space-invasion-simulator"
            >Play here</a
          >. This was another entry for JS13kgames 2021, I actually spent more
          time on this than on Jeff's nightmare, I only did that one to prove to
          myself I could implement the decentralized category. I was told the
          music was annoying, and it was laggy.

          your own adventure game featuring an amnesiac robot. Controls include
          arrow keys, y/n, and space, there's also a level editor available to
          coil members, so they can customize their experience. I made the music
          with <a href="https://keithclark.github.io/ZzFXM/">ZzFXM</a> by just
          basically fiddling around until I found something that sounded
          okayish... I'm not musical, so don't blame me if it's very basic. This

          >. This was my first try at making a javascript game, it gave me the
          confidence to try something harder.
