List of bugs (sorted by importance)
1. Sprite keeps apearing outside floor area on right side, something wrong with my if question
2. smart phone only detects tap not swipe
3. screen keeps getting wiggled around when using cell phone. 
4. start and restart screens don't resized
5. moving paddle should change direction of ball 
6. start and restart screens are plain and boring.
7. ball gets stuck temporarily and grinds sound when at the very edge of paddle.

Features I'd like:
1. Coins that are dropped after blue gremlin is hit
2. Gremlin dancing on the front page / restart page
3. Maybe it would be better to simplify keyboard keys to only left/right

Things I fixed, yay me!

- Mooning animation is out of sync - fixed by changing from counter to boolean right in update method
