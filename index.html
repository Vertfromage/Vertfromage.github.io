    <p class="timeline__blurb">I was invited to help as a second developer on the pretty punks NFT team. They wanted to integrate my game into their brand and also see if I could help with some other tasks. They were going to release a free mint of pretty pups. I was working to set up a contract and mint them using a bash script that would automatically mint them to the correct users from a list. Verbash and I had it almost ready when the leadership of the project began to fail and the market began to drop, and it ultimately never got minted even though the images and the code were ready.</p>
