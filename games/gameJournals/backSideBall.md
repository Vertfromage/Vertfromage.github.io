##First Thoughts - August 27th 20119##

   This is my game submission for [JS13KGAMES](https://js13kgames.com/ "js13kgames.com").  It's also the first HTML5 canvas game I ever made. And the 2nd html/javascript game I ever made. The first game was a straight html/javascript pong game that was only minimally modified from the tutorial.

   I had just finished playing with that game when I saw the js13kgames contest and I thought wouldn't it be fun to get a t-shirt! So I thought I feel like I undertand this html javascript stuff now I can do this. I thought what if I could make a hacky-sack version of pong that would be cool, instead of hitting it off paddles you hit it off knees and feet.  That's when I started googling how to make javascript html games adjust automatically for a screen and I realized that canvas would make this much easier.  So I found another tutorial for pong using canvas and spent a few hours wrapping my head around how it worked, then I started modifying it to make it work for my hacky idea, and to make it automatically adjust to screen size changes.  
   
   I had this wonderful fun idea about how to make it look like it was bouncing off a 3d wall instead of the edges of the screen which is when I realized, this doesn't look like hacky-sack it looks like wall ball or squash... so I had to decide change my idea or start researching gravity imitating ball movements... *did find a way to do it for next time*... but for now I thought I'd go with wall ball, I chose it over squash because I prefer one person games to 2 person and I didn't want to code a basic AI that wouldn't be competative enough and I don't have enough confidence to code a good one.
   
   I still want to make it respond to touch events so it will be a real mobile game, right now it only takes keyboard input. I also want to make it so if you go over a certain score you level up to 2 balls, and so on. There's a bug where you can get the ball lined up in one spot and let it keep going up and down to get a huge score and multiple balls will eliminate that.
   
##Update - Sept 4 2019##

  I've changed the name to backside ball to illustrate through the name that my game fits the *back* theme of the contest... as though the wiggling bum gremlin wouldn't be obvious on it's own... and it's a more fun name. In addition to the sprite I added sound, links to the tutorials I followed are at the top of the js file if anyone is reading this. (Assuming I've moved the javascript out of the html file, I still need to do that before I submit my game. 
  
  I'm divided about whether to remove the delay when the gremlin moons you, Mike says having the gremlin hold the ball interupts the game... I just think it's good from an artistic composition perspective drawing the eye to the focal point of the composition... in other words I don't want people to miss my joke while tracking the ball. Mike could be right, but I tried it his way and put it back because I like it my way... maybe I will consult Sarah. 

  Also I've gotten tired of trying to fix all the *issues* with the game mechanics... it's gotten to the point where I try to fix one thing I break something else.  I'm ready to just make it pretty and submit it to the contest, I'm just making it for fun anyways so if it's not as fun anymore maybe I should go back to learning java and take a break from javascript for a bit.
